Based on this series of Yes or No questions, the predictor space (a fancy name for all the independent variables i.e. X => X1, X2, X3, …, Xn) is split into segments. It is important to note that these segments are distinct and non-overlapping.\n",

    "    1. Is i > 99? If yes, then stop the loop else continue the next loop\n",
    "    2. Does ‘apple’ contain ‘a’? If yes, then increase count of ‘a’ by 1 else do nothing.\n",
    "    3. Similarly, here, we ask, is feature1 > threshold1? If yes, split the predictors into two segments. Segment 1 has the value of feature1 > threshold1 and Segment2 has the value of feature1 <threshold1. This process is then repeated.\n",
